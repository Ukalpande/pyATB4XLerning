 What does the ** Operator do in python, and how is it used..?
Ans --

The ** Operator is use for the alternative of Power in the python,
 it can also be used to assign power to a variable or expression

Ex. =
->print (4**4) 

->x = 20
print(x**4)
a = 23
b =20

print (

# example 3

 - Explain the difference between the = operator and the == operator in Python.

Ans - The Operator = use for the assignment, and the == operator is used for the  
      it use for assign the value to the variable or update the value of variable 
      
      Ex.
      
      x = 5
      y = 6
-     The == operator is used for the comparison for the two variable both are equal 

      Ex. 
      a= 10 
      b= 10 
      
      
      
      print(a==b)

- What does the ^ operator do in Python, and in what context is it commonly used?
Ans - The ^ Operator is use for the bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) operator 
      used as Bitwise XOR - This operation compares each bit of the first operand
      to the corresponding bit of the second operand.
      print(f"Bitwise XOR of a and b is : {a^b}")

     a = True
     b = False
    print(a ^ b)


"""


a= 2
b = 2
print((a+b)**2)
